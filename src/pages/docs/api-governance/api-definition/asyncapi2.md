You can use Postman to identify potential design issues when defining your [API definition](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/defining-an-api/) in [AsyncAPI 2 format](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0). For all APIs defined in AsyncAPI format, the following [Postman API Governance](/docs/api-governance/api-definition/api-definition-warnings/) rules describe warning messages and possible ways to resolve them.

## Define metadata with the info object

These rules enable you to define helpful metadata about your API.
This ensures your API’s consumers understand what they can do with
your API and how to contact your API’s owner.

<span id="postman-asyncapi-library_info-contact-defined"></span>

&nbsp;

### The contact object should be defined in the info object

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| The [info object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#infoObject) in your API definition doesn't have the [contact object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#contactObject), which has contact information such as the name and email of the contact. Contact information defines a contact person or organization for each of your organization's APIs. Your API's consumers can use the contact information to contact the person or organization directly, or the contact information can be available at an API portal or catalog. | Add the contact object with a `name`, `email`, or `url` field to the info object. |

#### Issue

The contact object isn't defined in the info object.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels: {}
```

&nbsp;

#### Resolution

The contact object is defined in the info object.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0

### The contact name should be defined in the contact object

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| The [info object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#infoObject) in your API definition doesn't have a `name` field in the [contact object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#contactObject). A contact name isn't required, but including a contact name gives your API's consumers the name of the person or organization to contact about your organization's APIs. | Add a `name` field to the contact object. |

#### Issue

A name isn't defined in the contact object.

```yaml

```

&nbsp;

<span id="postman-asyncapi-library_info-description-defined"></span>

&nbsp;

### The description should be defined in the info object

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| The [info object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#infoObject) in your API definition doesn't have a `description` field. A description isn't required, but including a description enables you to provide your API's consumers with information about what the API does and how to use it. This can be anything from a short description to a long explanation of possible uses cases. Defining the API's description during the design phase can help define the API's scope. | Add a `description` field to the info object. |

#### Issue

A description isn't defined in the info object.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels: {}

&nbsp;

<span id="postman-asyncapi-library_info-license-defined"></span>

&nbsp;

### The license object should be defined in the info object

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| The [info object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#infoObject) in your API definition doesn't have a [license object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#licenseObject), which has the license name and can optionally have a URL pointing to a web page that describes the license. License information helps your API's consumers understand how the API can be copied and used. | Add a license object to the info object. |

#### Issue

A license object isn't defined in the info object.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels: {}
```

&nbsp;

#### Resolution

A license object is defined in the info object.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
  description: An API description
  license:
    name: Apache 2.0
    url: https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0
channels: {}
```

&nbsp;

<span id="postman-asyncapi-library_info-license-url-defined"></span>

&nbsp;

### The license URL should be defined in the license object

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| The [info object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#infoObject) in your API definition doesn't have the `url` field in the [license object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#licenseObject), which provides a link to a web page that describes the license. A license URL isn't required, but a license name alone may not be not enough information for your API's consumers, especially when you use a custom license. | Add a `url` field to the license object. |

#### Issue

A license URL isn't defined in the license object.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
  license:
    name: Apache 2.0
channels: {}
```

channels: {}
```

&nbsp;

<span id="postman-asyncapi-library_info-termsofservice-defined"></span>

&nbsp;

### The terms of service URL should be defined in the info object

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| The [info object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#infoObject) in your API definition doesn't have a `termsOfService` field, which has a URL pointing to the terms of service for the API. A terms of service is often mandatory for public APIs. It's also recommended that private APIs provide a link to terms and conditions of using the API. | Add the `termsOfService` field to the info object. |

#### Issue

The `termsOfService` field isn't defined in the info object.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels: {}
```

## Describe operations with the operation object

These rules enable you to describe operations used in your API.
This ensures your API’s consumers understand how to use your API.

<span id="postman-asyncapi-library_operation-summary-defined"></span>

&nbsp;

### The operation object should have a summary

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| One or more [operation objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#operationObject) in your API definition don't have a `summary` field. A summary of what the operation does provides your API's consumers with important context that the channel name and operation object type ([subscribe](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#channelItemObjectSubscribe) or [publish](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#channelItemObjectPublish)) don't provide on their own. Many organizations use the API operation description that they create during the define phase of the API development process as the summary. | Add a `summary` field to each operation object. |

#### Issue

A summary isn't defined in the operation object.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels:
  aChannel:
    publish: {}
```

&nbsp;

#### Resolution

A summary is defined in the operation object.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels:
  aChannel:
    publish:
      summary: Summary of the operation
```

&nbsp;

<span id="postman-asyncapi-library_summary-period-none"></span>

&nbsp;

### The summary shouldn't end with a period

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| One or more [operation objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#operationObject), [operation trait objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#operationTraitObject), [message objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#messageObject), [message trait objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#messageTraitObject), or [message example objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#messageExampleObject), in your API definition have a summary that ends with a period (`.`). API documentation tools use the summary as a title, so it shouldn't end with a period. | Remove the final period from each `summary` field in each object. |

#### Issue

The summary ends with a period.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels:
  aChannel:
    publish:
      summary: Summary of the channel.
```

&nbsp;

#### Resolution

### The parameter object should have a description

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| One or more [operation objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#operationObject) in your API definition don't have a `description` field in one or more [parameter objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#parameterObject). When the parameter's name and context don't provide enough information for your API's consumers, a description can provide them with useful information about the parameter. | Add a `description` field to each parameter object. |

#### Issue

A description isn't defined in the parameter.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels:
  aChannel:
    parameters:

## Model data types with the schema object

These rules enable you to model data types used in your API,
ensuring your API’s consumers understand the data they’ll use
with your API. These rules also enable you to reuse components
throughout your API definition so you only need to design your
API schema once.

<span id="postman-asyncapi-library_schema-array-length-defined"></span>

&nbsp;

### The minimum and maximum number of items should be defined in the array's schema

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| One or more [schema objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#schemaObject) in your API definition have an array type property that doesn't define the `minItems` and `maxItems` fields. These fields define the minimum and maximum number of items the array type property can accept. It's important to provide item limits because applications that consume or provide APIs can only handle a limited number of items. | Add `minItems` and `maxItems` fields to array type properties in the schema object. |

#### Issue

The minimum and maximum number of items aren't defined in the array type property.

| One or more [schema objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#schemaObject) in your API definition have a string type property that doesn't define the `minLength` and `maxLength` fields. These fields define the minimum and maximum length the string type property can accept. It's important to provide length limits because applications that consume or provide APIs can only handle a limited string length. | Add `minLength` and `maxLength` fields to string type properties in the schema object. |

#### Issue

The minimum and maximum length aren't defined in the string type property.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels: {}
components:
  schemas:
    Schema:
      properties:
        aString:
          type: string
```

&nbsp;

#### Resolution

The minimum and maximum length are defined in the string type property.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels: {}
components:
  schemas:
    Schema:
      properties:
        aString:
          type: string
          minLength: 0
          maxLength: 10

### The schema object property should have a description

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| One or more properties in a [schema object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#schemaObject) in your API definition don't have a `description` field. When the schema's name and context don't provide enough information for your API's consumers, a description can provide them with useful information about the property. A complicated description may indicate a problem in the API's definition or design, so spending the time to create a description can help you identify any issues. | Add a `description` field to each schema property. |

#### Issue

A description isn't defined in the schema property.

```yaml
asyncapi: 2.6.0
info:
  title: An API name
  version: "1.0"
channels: {}
components:
  schemas:
    aSchema:
      properties:

### The operation object parameter should reference a reusable schema object

| Issue description | Possible fix |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| One or more [operation objects](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#operationObject) in your API definition define one or more parameters in a [parameter object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#parameterObject) that don't [reference](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#referenceObject) a reusable [schema object](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v2.6.0#schemaObject).
