As you work with the Live Collections Agent (LCA), you may encounter errors and receive error messages. The LCA diagnostics are still in alpha, so if anything is confusing please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch and ask the Live Insights team any questions.

The LCA displays errors and provides diagnostics so that you can act on them:

* Observe information received from the LCA on usage and error states, including interfaces, ports, and traffic (for example, HTTP vs. encrypted traffic, the busiest endpoints, and so on).
* Review status messages and act on them.

To access the error message, select the Live Collections icon <img alt="Live Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/icon-live-collections.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the collection.
